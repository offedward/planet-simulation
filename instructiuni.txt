Info: this is a python project that should theoretically represent a solar system , where I 
used real values of the planets , physics , mass and radius of them. Theoretically this should work 
like our solar system , because some of the planets moves faster and other a bit slowly like the red one.

How to use: in order to execute this .py file you will need python installed on your computer. Open a CMD 
or a Terminal and go to your directory where you cloned these files. Use "python" or "python3" followed by the
name of the file

Hope you enjoy this simulation. 

*this is just for testing / reversing to initial version later*
